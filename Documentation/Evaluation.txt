All the gameplay features are working in the game. 
The collision detection is working so you can push boxes to make a path through the level 
but you cannot push one box into another game object (another box or wall).
The timer works and indicates the when the game is lost and there is also an indication that the game is won 
and then the game can be restarted. 

The particles effects explosion is not working in the game this is because
it doesn't set to the correct position.  

There were some bugs that we didn't have time to fix, including the particle effects explosion,
Also had an issue with the background music not stopping once the level was over. When you transition back into
bush court there is a problem with the resize. 


There are random crashes in the release version so it is best to run the project in debug mode.
